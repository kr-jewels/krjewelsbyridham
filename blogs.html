    <h1>What is Anti-Tarnish Jewellery? Why It's Trending in 2025</h1>
    <p><strong>Published by KR by Ridham | June 2025</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Anti-tarnish jewellery</strong> is becoming a buzzword in the fashion and accessories world — and for good reason. Whether you're dressing up for a wedding, office, or daily outings, you want your jewellery to stay as brilliant as the day you bought it. This is where anti-tarnish jewellery steps in as a game-changer.</p>

    <h2>What is Anti-Tarnish Jewellery?</h2>
    <p>Anti-tarnish jewellery is specially coated to resist oxidation and corrosion, meaning it doesn't darken or lose its shine over time. The protective layer — often a micro-coating of lacquer, rhodium, or gold — acts as a barrier between the metal and moisture, sweat, and air.</p>

    <h2>Why is it Trending in 2025?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Longevity:</strong> Modern buyers want jewellery that lasts, even if it isn't made of pure gold or silver.</li>
      <li><strong>Affordability:</strong> Anti-tarnish pieces offer a luxurious look without the premium price tag.</li>
      <li><strong>Low Maintenance:</strong> No more polishing or cleaning every week.</li>
      <li><strong>Skin-Friendly:</strong> Most coatings are hypoallergenic, perfect for sensitive skin types.</li>
      <li><strong>Eco-Conscious Shoppers:</strong> With less need for chemical cleaning, these products are more sustainable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Care for Anti-Tarnish Jewellery</h2>
    <p>Though they resist tarnish, these tips will keep your jewellery looking new:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Store them in a dry, airtight pouch or box.</li>
      <li>Avoid contact with perfumes, lotions, and water when possible.</li>
      <li>Wipe gently with a soft cloth after use.</li>
    </ul>
